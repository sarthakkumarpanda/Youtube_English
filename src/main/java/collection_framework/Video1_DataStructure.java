	//Data structure - way to store data memory in an efficient way
	//efficient means - time and space complexities.
	
	//java has 8 primitive data types so we can store data in a simple fashion
	//int a = 1, char c = 'a' and something like that which can store simple small size data
	
	//types of Data Structure - Basically 2 types
	//1. Primitive DS - int, short, byte, long, char, boolean, float, double
	
	//2. Non-Primitive DS. This is further divided into Linear and Non-Linear DS
	//   Linear - String, Arrays, List, Set, Queue, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, etc.
	//   Non-Linear - Graphs and Trees
	
	//difference between primitive and non-primitive DS
	//primitive DS cannot store multiple data
	//for e.g., String S1 = "abcde"; so here a b c d e are multiple characters so this cannot be done by non-primitive DS
	//similiary arrays can also store multiple data at one place for e.g., int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
	
	//primitive DS can be used to write simple programs such as Calculator, Snake Game, Currency Converter, etc.
	//but non-primitive DS can be used for large scale applications such as e-commerce, social networking, banking, etc.
	
	//Explain giving example of a typical webpage in Amazon or Flipkart.
	//Explain search[any laptop] algorithm, sorting algorithm[price low to high]
	
	//Collection framework is part of Non-Primitive DS which is nothing but a pre-defined API
